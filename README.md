This thesis presents the design and development of an interactive web application for performing Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) using the R Shiny framework. The primary goal of the application is not only to perform accurate statistical analyses but also to deliver the results in a way that is accessible and understandable to users, including those without advanced statistical training. To achieve this goal, the application integrates traditional ANOVA methods (one-way and two-way) with automatic assumption checks, post hoc analyses, effect size calculations, and rich graphical visualizations. Analysis of variance is one of the core methods used to detect the variation in the values of a quantitative variable across the levels of one or more factors, widely used in both the natural and social sciences. When documenting the results in any scientific work or publication, it is essential to follow a standardized presentation format to ensure that the reader is fully and coherently informed about the method’s outcomes.
A distinguishing feature of the application is its ability to generate natural language interpretations of statistical results. These interpretations describe the statistical significance and strength of each factor’s effect, providing context through clear summaries based on the model’s F-values, p-values, and eta-squared effect sizes. The system also includes interactive visualizations, such as violin plots, raincloud plots, and confidence interval charts with Tukey labels, allowing for dynamic exploration of the data. The application aims to simplify the reporting process by providing users with a comprehensive HTML report that combines statistical results, diagnostic tests, and graphical analyses into a single document suitable for academic and professional use. By linking statistical computation with understandable interpretation, the application fulfills the thesis goal of facilitating applied science researchers and students in performing this specific statistical method.
